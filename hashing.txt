hashing is the process of converting a given input key(generally arbirtrarty size) into o
output value(generally fixed size)

HASH FUNCTION
used to map data of arbirtrarty size to fixed-size values.

NOTE
Time Complexity of storing data (O(1))
Time Complexity of Access -(insert,update,delete)


collision happens when the hash function generates
same hash(output) for different set of keys(inputs)
NOTE:
The fact that hashing maps any input (rgardless of its length) into  a fixed-length code(outpu)
